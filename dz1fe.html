        <h1>Best New Sports Cars of 2023 and 2024</h1>
        <h3>Sports cars deliver a level of driving entertainment that's inspiring to enthusiasts like us; traditional needs,
            such as fuel economy, cargo space, and in some instances, rear seats, take second fiddle to driver engagement and
            grin-inducing acceleration and handling. Sports cars come in varying degrees of thrill, running the gamut from the
            lightweight, low-powered Mazda MX-5 Miata to the pricey but powerful Porsche 911 Turbo. Despite their differences,
            these two sports cars, like almost all of the vehicles in this segment, share a common thread: driver satisfaction.
            To draw a line in the sand, we split sport compacts such as the Honda Civic Type R and Hyundai Elantra N, into their
            own hatchback and small car segments, respectively.</h3>
    <h3>
        As the MX-5 Miata is any indication, there's more to making our Editor's Choice list in this field than loads of
        horsepower. The scales that make a great sports car require balance, and the best sports cars are as thrilling on public
        roads as they are on private race tracks. There's no set equation for the perfect sports car, but in order to find the
        best out there, we measure every one of these machines on the test track to help us determine the models that split the
        difference between on-road comfort and tarmac-tearing performance. The sports cars on our 2023 Editor's Choice list
        exemplify are more than just fun to drive; these vehicles share the fundamental qualities that separate great cars from
        merely good ones.

        <h3>The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 walks the thin line that separates where the everyday meets the racetrack. Using the
            everyday Camaro (reviewed separately) as a building block, the tornado that is the ZL1 makes the mighty 455-hp
            Camaro LT1 and SS trims feel like comparative wind gusts. Credit the ZL1's trim-exclusive 650-hp supercharged V-8,
            as well as its wide Goodyear F1 SuperCar tires that are as sticky as s'mores. An available 1LE performance package
            awakes an even mightier beast, with the package adding even wider and stickier tires, adjustable camber plates at
            each corner, and Multimatic's Dynamic Suspension Spool Valve dampers. Think of the Camaro ZL1 as a NASCAR Cup Series
            racer for the street.</h3>
